## Description
The Quotes by Angular is simply a webpage that allows users to enter quotes,the author of the quote, and his/her name as the user and the quote is displayed in a card.

Once the user submits the quotes, the quote appears on the `QUOTES` Section in the webpage.

There is a red trash icon in the card which when clicked, deletes the entire quote from the page

A user can like or dislike a quote by clicking on either the upvote or downvote icons.
